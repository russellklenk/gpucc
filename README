The GPUCC project is a dynamic link library that acts as a front-end for various
GPU program => bytecode compilers such as the LLVM/Clang-based dxcompiler, the 
pre-SM6.0 D3DCompiler, the glslangValidator => SPIR-V compiler, the NVRTCC CUDA
compiler, and so on.

There are various output bytecode formats, such as DXIL (for Direct3D), SPIR-V 
(for Vulkan and possibly OpenGL and OpenCL), and PTX (CUDA). The user selects 
a target bytecode format and feature level, which is then used to select the 
compiler.

There are two primary use cases - one, GPUCC is used as part of a content build
pipeline to perform offline compilation of GPU programs. The second use case 
loads the library into the process address space at runtime using the provided 
loader shim and performs runtime shader compilation for artist/engineer 
iteration.
